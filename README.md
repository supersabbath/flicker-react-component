# This web app to a React-Redux demo 

# Why Redux?

# Redux is a stylis what to organize the state of the application as well as a desing patter to follow at develepement.

# React redux also allows code re utilization if developing apps with react native

# Pros is havinging a scafolding to follow while using react 

# The cons: as any other JS library , framework , is that it has lots of posible configuraiton and could become overwehelming to configure

# thats why I decided to use a boilerplate :

# As a starting point I used [www.reactboilerplate.com](https://www.reactboilerplate.com) 

# It offers everything that we need , hot relaoding , redux configuration , some Cli commands, propTypes , styled-component

# Regaring the boiler plate I decided to remove Saga.js as as it added more complexity that require for this demo and just use redux-thunk

# For css this project uses  [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/basics#motivation). Integrates very well with React. See the <ThemeProvider>  and LoadingIndicator
